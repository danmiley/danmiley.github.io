To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run Jekyll with Bundler. Use the command bundle exec jekyll serve in the root of your repository (after switching to the gh-pages branch for project repositories), and your site should be available at http://localhost:4000. For a full list of Jekyll commands, see the Jekyll documentation.

You may also wish to add the {% feed_meta %} tag to your layout's <head> section to allow browsers to more easily discover your site's feed.
