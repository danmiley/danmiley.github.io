#+TITLE: AWS Reinvent 2015 Findings and Sessions
#+DESCRIPTION: AWS Reinvent
#+CATEGORIES:  tech
#+TAGS: aws cloud scaling reinvent

For Adobe/Oz, AWS Re:invent 2015 was the occasion for several important announcements.
Primary themes this year:
	- Major Enterprise conversions from hosted to cloud
	- Business analytics offerings
	- Internet of Things Platform 
	- Deployment Tooling and Orchestration management
	- Serverless platforms   - no server is easier to manage than 'no server'

A few of the interesting product announcements were:
 	- Amazon Inspector - security assessment tool
	- Lambda extensions -  VPC,  5 minute max from 60 sec, Scheduling
	- ECS Registry - out later this year.
	- QuickSight - business analytics tool
	- MariaDB - next gen iteration MySQL
	- IoT -    AWS platform, this was an unpleasant surprise for the IoT startups attending
	- Kinesis Firehose - get big volumes of data into Kinesis...   value for Kinesis user base
	- Snowball - accelerate enterprise conversion to cloud.  one Customers' Petabyte legacy stores would otherwise take "8 years" to transfer over wire.
	
Missing (at least for us) was a hope of.
	- AWS hosted MongoDB
	- Lambda support for ruby (we got python instead)

The serverless platform theme is especially interesting, external customers reported a 2X order of magnitude reduction in costs.
The implicit bargain we see here is cost reduction in exchange for vendor lockin. AWS is a big absorber of open source solutions
but is pointedly not making Lambda available as open soure, keeping the proprietary edge.   

There were complaints from startups about Amazon announcements that collided with the emergent AWS ecosystem.
Amazon response here is that they warn companies not to develop ahead of their roadmap.   Problem is that AWS roadmap
changes quickly and can be difficult to know what is coming.

We at Oz/Adobe have seen this as well, probably makes sense to check in regularly with AWS Adobe contacts on AWS Roadmap with our partner status to avoid inventing.

I did one bootcamp.. the scalable Microservices automation pipeline camp. The full AWS CI toolchain with Jenkins, DockerHub and ECS.
My progress included:

	- start with reference weather / stock type microservice
	- CodePipeline - model/setup build test and deploy 
	- AWS CodeDeploy/CLoudformation  - continuous deploys to a fleet (old Apollo amazon internal tool)
	- Jenkins - we were given a jenkins server for tests
	- build Docker containers from CLI
	- Push to Dockoer Hub 
	- Deploy Service on ECS
	- tests run on production
	- integrate Consul for service discovery

Werner's Keynote, some big-picture great insights here, I would say worth watching the whole session.

Werner referred to this seminal paper written in the 1960's on the management of complexity:
